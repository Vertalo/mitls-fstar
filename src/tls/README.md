# Naming conventions


### Parsers and wire-formats: Related to EverParse

* `Parsers`: Auto-generated by EverParse

* `Parsers.Aux`: Hand-written adapters around Parsers

* `MITLS.Repr`: Hand-written adapters around Parsers

### Cryptographic algorithms and constructions: Related to EverCrypt

* `Model`: Cryptographic games expressed on algorithmic specifications
  (e.g., `Model.CRF`, referring only to hacl-star's
  `Spec.Hash.Definitions`)

* `Flag`, `Flags`, `DebugFlags`, `TLSInfoFlags`: Idealization flags,
  to be cleaned up

* `Crypto`: Wrappers doing conditional idealization on top of
  EverCrypt, e.g., `Crypto.Hash` or `Crypto.CRF`

* `CommonDH`: An abstract interface for Diffie-Hellman operations

* `Idx`: Cryptographic indexes for keyed functionalities and deals with honesty

* `Pkg`: Cryptographic packages for keyed functionalities

* `Pkg.Tree`: Tree of packages with key-derivation functions as nodes

* `IV`: Packaged functionality for initialization vectors

* `HMAC.UFCMA`: Packaged functionality for UFCMA based on HMAC

* `AEAD.Pkg`: Packaged functionality for AEAD

### Handshake

* `Nonce`: connection identifiers (should be `TLS.Nonce`?)

* `TLS.Handshake`: Main API for the handshake protocol

* `TLS.Handshake.State`: Definitions of the states in the the TLS state machine
   -- to be superceded by `experiments/TLS.Handshake.Machine.fst`

* `TLS.Handshake.Client` and `TLS.Handshake.Server`: main transitions
  for the handshake state machines

* `TLS.Handshake.Send`: State and auxiliary functions for handling handshake message sending

* `TLS.Handshake.Receive`: A wrapper around `ParseFlights` providing a
  single-buffer oriented interface

* `TLS.Handshake.ParseFlights`: Using EverParse to parse flights of incoming messages

* `HSL.Transcript`: Implements the transcript hash and corresponding state machine
   --- Should be renamed to `TLS.Handshake.Transcript`

* `Negotiation` (Should be `TLS.Handshake.Negotiation`), including low-level experiments

* `Negotiation.Version`: Version negotiation, with sample low-level code

* `Negotiation.Writers`: An experiment with low-level writers for extensions (should move to experiments)?

### Configuration

* `experiments/TLS.Config`: New configuration adapted from the end
  of TLSConstants; not yet integrated.

* `TLSConstants`: Should be renamed to `TLS.??`?

* `TLSInfo`

* `TLS.Callbacks`

### APIs

* `Connection`

### Auxiliary files

* `Mem`: around the Low* memory model

* `TLSError`: Error handling; but see
  https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Proposal:-Effect-Layering
  for an upcoming way of writing effectful error handling code in a
  more modular manner. Ongoing work by Aseem in F* branches ...


### Utilities

* `BufferBytes`: conversion functions, should be subsumed by new functions in FStar.Bytes

### To be eventually removed

- `Hashing.*`: Byte-oriented crypto
- `AEAD.Provider`: Byte-oriented crypto
- `HSL.Receive`: superceded by TLS.Handshake.ParseFlights
